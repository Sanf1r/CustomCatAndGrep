[Intro]
Hmmmmm

[Verse 1: Tim Foust]
Far over the Misty Mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day
To find our long forgotten gold

[Verse 2: Tim Foust]
The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red, it flaming spread
The trees like torches blazed with light

[Verse 3: Peter Hollens]
The wind was on the withered heath
But in the forest stirred no leaf
There shadows lay be night or day
And dark things silent crept beneath

[Interlude]
Aaaahh aaahh
Aaaahh aaahh

[Verse 4: Peter Hollens]
The wind went on from West to East
All movement in the forest ceased
But shrill and harsh across the marsh
Its whistling voices were released

[Verse 5: Both]
Farewell we call to hearth and hall!
Though wind may blow and rain may fall
We must away ere break of day
Far o'er the wood and mountain tall
