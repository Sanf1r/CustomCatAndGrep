Don Corleone: “Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?
If you’d come to me in friendship, this scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.
And if by some chance an honest man like yourself made enemies they would become my enemies.
And then, they would fear you.”
